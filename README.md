# Cuelib

This is a fork of the now abandoned [Cuelib](http://code.google.com/p/cuelib). It hasn't been rebranded since no functionality has been changed. The changes in this fork is that the code has been upgraded to Java 7, logging has been changed from JUL to [SLF4j](http://www.slf4j.org/) and heavily cleaned up. Some bugs have also been fixed and some minor improvements implemented, but the most significant change is that it has been mavenized and split into modules. This, unlike the original, is hosted at Maven Central.

The modules are as follows:
* [![Maven Central](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/org.digitalmediaserver/cuelib-parent/badge.svg)](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/org.digitalmediaserver/cuelib-parent) `cuelib-parent` - this only functions as the parent POM for the other modules.
* [![Maven Central](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/org.digitalmediaserver/cuelib-core/badge.svg)](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/org.digitalmediaserver/cuelib-core) `cuelib-core` - this contains the CUE parser itself and only depends on [SLF4j](http://www.slf4j.org/).
* [![Maven Central](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/org.digitalmediaserver/cuelib-id3/badge.svg)](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/org.digitalmediaserver/cuelib-id3) `cuelib-id3` - this contains what seems to be an unfinished [ID3](http://id3.org/) parser. It only depends on [SLF4j](http://www.slf4j.org/).
* [![Maven Central](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/org.digitalmediaserver/cuelib-tools/badge.svg)](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/org.digitalmediaserver/cuelib-tools) `cuelib-tools` - this contains the command line tools for cutting tracks etc. It depends on [SLF4j](http://www.slf4j.org/) and [Logback](http://logback.qos.ch).

Even though the functionality is the same as in Cuelib `1.2.1`, this fork starts at version number `2.0.0`. This is to indicate the changed coordinates and modularization. This fork maintains the previous API, with a couple of new overloads to be able to control the character encoding, but it's not a drop-in replacement. That is because the dependencies must be adjusted to use the necessary modules, and because the imports must be changed from `jwbroek.cuelib` to `org.digitalmediaserver.cuelib`. The packages have also been slightly reorganized as a result of the modularization. Modifying existing code to depend on this fork instead should be very easy.
