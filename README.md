# Cuelib

This is a fork of the now abandoned [Cuelib](http://code.google.com/p/cuelib). It hasn't been rebranded since the API and the functionality has been kept. The changes in this fork is that the code has been upgraded to Java 7, logging has been changed from JUL to [SLF4j](http://www.slf4j.org/) and heavily cleaned up, some bugs have been fixed and some minor improvements implemented. In addition, it has been Mavenized and split into modules and parsing of cue sheets embedded in FLACs has been implemented. The FLAC metadata parsing supports for both the `CUESHEET` and the `VORBIS_COMMENT` blocks. This fork, unlike the original, is hosted at Maven Central.

The modules are as follows:
* [![Maven Central](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/org.digitalmediaserver/cuelib-parent/badge.svg)](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/org.digitalmediaserver/cuelib-parent) `cuelib-parent` - this only functions as the parent POM for the other modules.
* [![Maven Central](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/org.digitalmediaserver/cuelib-core/badge.svg)](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/org.digitalmediaserver/cuelib-core) `cuelib-core` - this contains the CUE parser itself and only depends on [SLF4j](http://www.slf4j.org/).
* [![Maven Central](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/org.digitalmediaserver/cuelib-id3/badge.svg)](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/org.digitalmediaserver/cuelib-id3) `cuelib-id3` - this contains what seems to be an unfinished [ID3](http://id3.org/) parser. It only depends on [SLF4j](http://www.slf4j.org/).
* [![Maven Central](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/org.digitalmediaserver/cuelib-tools/badge.svg)](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/org.digitalmediaserver/cuelib-tools) `cuelib-tools` - this contains the command line tools for cutting tracks etc. It depends on [SLF4j](http://www.slf4j.org/) and [Logback](http://logback.qos.ch).

This fork starts at version number `2.0.0`. This is to indicate the changed coordinates and modularization. This fork maintains the previous API with some additions and deprecations, but it's stll not a drop-in replacement. That's because the dependencies must be adjusted to use the necessary modules, and because the imports must be changed from `jwbroek.cuelib` to `org.digitalmediaserver.cuelib`. The packages have also been slightly reorganized as a result of the modularization. Modifying existing code to depend on this fork instead should be very easy though.
